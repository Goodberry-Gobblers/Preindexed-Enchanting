## Features

### Enchantment Slots
<details open>

The flagship feature of the mod, enchantment slots. As defined by the , any enchantments can be applied to these items (even mutally exclusive ones) as long as the sum of their levels is equal to or less than the item's max enchantment slots.

Curses increase the amount of slots an item has (default is +2 per curse), which can allow you to squeeze more out of your gear at a price.

There are special edge cases for when an item is set to have either 0 or 32,767 enchantment slots. Respectively, these create unenchantable and infintiely enchantable items.
